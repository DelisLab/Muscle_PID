This repository provides Matlab code to implement the computational framework described in:

Quantifying the diverse contributions of hierarchical muscle interactions to motor function
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569159v2)

Alongside these codes, we have provided an example implementation of this framework in 'example_code.m'. 

The framework can be successfully executed using these codes alone however, credit is given for important features of this code directly adapted from: \
